		<h2>About</h2>

		<p><img src="/assets/portrait.jpg" alt="Photo of Owen"></p>
<p>This website is a simple collection of my thoughts, experiments, and experiences as a human being and as a developer.</p>
<p>As of May 2018, I&#39;ve been aSoftware Developer at <a href="https://www.d2l.com">D2L</a> for six years. I was at one time a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. Having first touched a computer at two years old, I haven&#39;t yet looked away. I enjoy experimenting with new ideas and technologies, proving concepts, and having fun with the code I write.</p>
<p>Computer security and world education are two areas of our global society which I am greatly interested in. While I don&#39;t pretend to be an expert, breaking and evading systems is incredibly interesting. Is our web actually secure? How do we subvert censorship efforts? How do I have a private conversation with someone? These are the sort of questions I ask myself, and spend time researching; and, while I haven&#39;t contributed to the field yet, that will hopefully change in the future. As for our education systems&hellip; why do they suck, and how can we make them better?</p>
